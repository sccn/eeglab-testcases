Multi-subject, multi-modal (sMRI+EEG) neuroimaging dataset
on face processing. Original data described at https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20151
This is repackaged version of the EEG data in EEGLAB format. The data has gone through
minimal preprocessing including (see wh_extracteeg_BIDS.m):
- Ignoring fMRI and MEG data (sMRI preserved for EEG source localization)
- Extracting EEG channels out of the MEG/EEG fif data
- Adding fiducials
- Renaming EOG and EKG channels
- Extracting events from event channel
- Removing spurious events 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19
- Removing spurious event 24 for subject 3 run 4
- Renaming events taking into account button assigned to each subject
- Correcting event latencies (events have a shift of 34 ms)
- Resampling data to 250 Hz (this is a step that is done because
  this dataset is used as tutorial for EEGLAB and need to be lightweight)
- Merging run 1 to 6
- Removing event fields urevent and duration 
- Filling up empty fields for events boundary and stim_file.
- Saving as EEGLAB .set format
